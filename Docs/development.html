            <h1>Development Process</h1>
            <p>
                The development of Booky was a multi-step journey that combined technical problem-solving, creative design, and iterative refinement. 
                Each phase of the process played a crucial role in transforming the initial concept into a fully functional bookstore application. 
                This page outlines the key stages of development, from preparing the foundational dataset to implementing the user interface 
                and refining the recommendation system. By breaking down each step, this section provides a comprehensive view of how Booky was 
                built and the considerations that shaped its final form.

            <h2>Identifying and Cleaning the Dataset</h2>
            <p>
                The development process began with identifying a suitable dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> to 
                serve as the foundation for the recommendation system. The  dataset I found was pulled from an online bookstore full of 
                real books and their authors, genres, and other valuable metadata. After selecting the dataset, I thoroughly cleaned it 
                to ensure it was ready for use. This involved removing inconsistencies, duplicates, and irrelevant entries, as well as 
                addressing missing or incomplete data by removing them.

                The cleaning and preparation process was all done using Microsoft Excel and its data transformation wizard. 
                During this process, I was able to familiarize myself with the data and was able to start planning for the 
                next development phase.

                <h2>Designing the Database</h2>
                <p>
                    Once the dataset was cleaned, I used it to design the database. This step involved organizing the data 
                    to be normalized and restructured to help the performance of different queries. This stage is when I 
                    planned all of the functions I wanted the application to have, such as giving users a wishlist they can 
                    manage, or storing the user activity to improve the quality of the recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After planning out the tables, I built the database in the MySql Workbench I restructured the csv file 
                    I had with the cleaned data and seperated it into multiple files with the corresponding table headers 
                    so I could easily import the data into the database using the import wizard. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was one of the hardest parts of the whole process because the data I used from the descriptions 
                    was not entirely compatable for a quick and easy import process. Every other table I imported was fine, 
                    but the description for the books had characters that were not UTF-8 and the import wizard had trouble 
                    reading it. After a lot of trial and error, I replaced these characters with question marks using a 
                    python script, and the import went through.

                <h2>Collecting Images For Books</h2>
                <p>
                    To enhance the application's visual appeal and user experience, I thought it was important to have 
                    images for each book. However, the dataset did not come with any, so I had to find a way to efficiently 
                    collect the images to display on the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To accomplish this, I figured writing a script to go through and find images online with the associated 
                    title, author, and year would be the best way to do so. This would mean that it would not always be the 
                    appropriate cover image, but I figured it was more important to have something users can look at than 
                    nothing at all. The image files were saved as their respective book_id.jpg
                </p>
                <p>
                    BeautifulSoup, pandas, and urllib along with other built in python libraries were used to collect the 
                    images associated with the books. Some could not find an image, but there is a default value in place 
                    for those instances. 
                </p>


            </div>
            <p></p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h2>Planning the User Interface</h2>
            <p>
                With the database complete, I shifted my focus towards the design of the application. I knew I wanted users to 
                interact with icons, and the simplest way I could do this would be by formatting them in PowerPoint and 
                then saving them as pictures to put into the picture boxes or buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this in mind, I thought it would be best to use a basic white background across the form, and select 
                a color from the PowerPoint pallete and build off of there. This would be best for me because there is 
                access to limitless icons to use for my application
            </p>
            <p>
                I would use this blue-white color scheme throughout the project and would use icons whenever to guide
                 users. To tie this together I thought it would be best to have rounded panels and buttons to really 
                 give the project a different look. It was also important for me to not have users jump around from 
                 form to form whenever possible, so I knew I had to learn how to build panels, create an instance of 
                 them, and place them in the form. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <div class="image-container" id="panel">
                <img src="images/app_home_panel.jpg" alt="Booky Home Panel" >
            </div>
            <h2>Implementing My Design</h2>
            <p>
                The implementation phase involved building the application one panel at a time. Each component was 
                developed individually, starting with the home page and moving on to features like search functionality 
                and the book details view. After each panel was completed, I tested and refined it to ensure it met both 
                design and functionality requirements. The modular design made it so that as I finished and implemented 
                a component of the project, I wouldn't have to worry about it malfunctioning as I developed the rest of the program 
            </p>
            <p>
                Implementing the design in such a way made it possible to simplify the recommendation process by allowing different 
                user controls to receive a list of books ids based on the user, and using it to generate the view. In this case with 
                the home, it appears empty but when a user logs in, the carousel in the two vertical panels is generated. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h2>Recommendation System</h2>
            <p>
                The recommendation system has been and will be a constant work in progress. There are two main recommendation systems
                in the application, the first recommends a category based on the users activity, and the second looks at the user activity
                and compares it to other users to offer a recommendation list.
            </p>
            <div class="image-container" id="recs">
                <img src="images/recommendations.jpg" alt="two recommendation carousels from the application">
            </div>
            <p>
                The first simply weighs the users activity by type, such as a purchase, bookmark, or view, and sorts it by category and finally
                produces a carousel where the user can see a shortlist of books in their favorite category. It also becomes the category the
                user first sees when they enter the category search.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main recommendaton system is the heart behind the for you page. It first identifies users who have interacted with the same books,
                these interactions are weighted and then sorted. The threshold for how similar a user must be can be tweaked to improve the performance 
                of the system. Once identifying the similar users it sorts the other books those users have interacted with, giving a higher score to
                books they have bought. Finally it removes any books that the main user has bought and returns a list sorted by the recommendation strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, I feel I have not simulated nearly enough data for this algorithm to give good enough recommendations, but I am confident 
                that it would significantly improve as more user data is added to the database. Moreover, some users may not have enough activity 
                data to build recommendations off of, as a fallback the system will generate the more popular books in the past month.
