            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>
                The journey of developing Booky has been an invaluable learning experience, providing me with deeper 
                insights into software development, database management, and user interface design. Throughout this 
                process, I encountered challenges, explored solutions, and gained practical skills that will be 
                instrumental in future projects.

            <h2>Skills I Developed</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Database Integration</summary>
                <p>
                    One of the most significant aspects of this project was connecting a Windows Forms application 
                    to a database. I gained hands-on experience with designing a relational database, writing SQL 
                    scripts, and ensuring efficient data retrieval. This step highlighted the importance of careful 
                    schema design and data integrity in creating a reliable application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the proccess I would learn a lot about SQL and effectively using it to collect 
                    information I need. I learned to effectively join tables, use aggregate functions and grouping 
                    to analyze whats hot, and writing nested queries to filter and weigh data for recommendations
                </p>

            <details>
                <summary>User Interface Design</summary>
                <p>
                    Planning and implementing the applicationâ€™s user interface taught me how to balance aesthetics 
                    with functionality. From selecting an appealing color scheme to designing an intuitive navigation 
                    flow, I learned the value of thoughtful UI/UX design in enhancing the user experience.
                </p>

            <details>
                <summary>Event-Driven Programming</summary>
                <p>
                    Working with event-driven programming in C# allowed me to create dynamic interactions within 
                    the application. By setting up responsive features such as event listeners for navigation, I 
                    saw how small details could significantly improve usability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned the most about this when troubleshooting the custom controls like the book cards 
                    or the carousel, making them interact with the main dashboard to send the user to the specified
                     book on click was troublesome to learn but now I can handle it with confidence and clarity
                </p>

            <details>
                <summary>Project Management and Iterative Development</summary>
                <p>
                    Managing the project through its whole life cycle, from the simple idea and requirements, 
                    to the final product and its maintenance, has reinforced the concepts of careful planning 
                    that I've come across over the semesters. <br><br>
                    Because of the scale of this project, I pushed myself to learn and use Git to not only have 
                    a backup, but to also be able to look back and see the way my program developed over time.

            <h2>Potential Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                While I am proud of what I accomplished with Booky, there are areas I would like to refine or enhance 
                in the future
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Improved Recommendation System</summary>
                <p>
                    I've mentioned that by adding data and users the quality of the recommendation system could improve, 
                    but there is far greater opportunity with an improved database structure and machine learning 
                    integration. One way this could happen is with the original data, creating a table with all the 
                    individual categories as table attributes as either a 1 or a 0. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using that as the foundation for the recommendation system would potential elevate the quality of 
                    the recommendation system tenfold and would be something I would love to come back to in the future.
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Performance Optimization</summary>
                <p>
                    I've been reading about different techniques for optimizing queries but don't understand enough to
                     want to implement any of them yet. Techniques like indexing or caching could be explored to handle
                      everything better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One serious concern I have with the project at the moment is that I create a new instance of each 
                    section of the user interface whenever it is called, and not once do I delete previous instances or 
                    subscriptions to events, so memory usage is quite high. 
                    This could potentially be a quick fix, but I am not familiar with how to approach this yet, and the 
                    program is able to run it fine so far. 
                </p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Enhanced Features</summary>
                <p>
                    This project could still see some features being added, like an administrator dashboard, or current 
                    features could be improved like the back button to bring a user back to their previous page.
                </p>

            <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                The development of Booky has been both challenging and rewarding, offering an opportunity to put 
                theoretical knowledge into practice while fostering creativity and problem-solving skills. I honestly 
                fell in love with the process, whilte it was demanding, each step of the process provided new insights 
                and learning opportunities, and it has left me inspired to tackle more ambitious projects in the future.
